# Volunteering Quick Start Guide

## Sign up to Campfire

Before you can use Campfire you'll need to sign up, then complete for your volunteer contract. A link to the application form will have been provided by your organisation.

Read more about the [Campfire sign up process](./application/signing-up-to-campfire.md).

## Joining a team

Volunteering on Campfire is done through a team. Every location where your organisation runs a shift or service is powered by its own team; individual days/schedules even have individual teams (e.g. Tuesday Musgrave Park and Friday Musgrave Park will have two separate teams).
