# Volunteering Quick Start Guide

## Joining a team

Volunteering on Campfire is done through a team. Every location where your organisation runs a shift or service is powered by its own team; individual days/schedules even have individual teams (e.g. Tuesday Musgrave Park and Friday Musgrave Park will have two separate teams).
