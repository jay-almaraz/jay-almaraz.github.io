# Campfire is rebranding!
{: .fs-10 }

## Q: Why are we rebranding?

A: We believe the timing is perfect for a rebrand. We're now over 18 months into helping volunteer-involving organisations, and we believe we understand, more than ever, the needs of our partners (that's you!) We want to reflect our aims to support you further in creating impact and adding value; rebranding to Volaby aligns us perfectly with this vision.

## Q: What does Volaby mean?

A: Volaby is volunteering, simple as A to B.

We don't sell tents. We want to work with teams like yours to build a volunteering experience that grows with your needs. Our goal is to connect good people with good technology, and we want it to feel as simple as A to B.

## Q: When is the change happening?

A: Campfire will become Volaby at 07:00 AEST on Monday, 26 October. This will include updating the names and logos across all of our social platforms too.

## Q: How will my volunteers know about the change?

### 1. Emails

- Introductory email on Friday, 23 October: This email will include a version of these FAQs for the volunteer, informing them of the new brand and assuring them that they won't be affected by the update, and that they aren't required to do anything.
- Launch announcement email on Monday, 26 October: This email will be the official release of the Volaby brand, and will coincide with the deployment of the new logos, colours, URLs, etc. Again, your volunteers will be told that they are not expected to do anything in response to the update; service will be uninterrupted.

### 2. In-app content

Once Volaby is launched, we will show an in-app popup message to all volunteers the next time they sign in. This will give them the heads up on the changes, link them to their own special FAQs document (similar to this one).

## Q: Will this disrupt my volunteers?

A: No.

All existing bookmarks, links, and shortcuts to Campfire will be automatically redirected to the Volaby. Shortcut icons will update themselves after a couple of visits. Sign in email addresses and passwords will be entirely unchanged.

The more observant members of your team may notice:

- Everybody will start being redirecting from `yourteam.campfireapp.org` to our new URL.
- The logos and icons will be using the new Volaby name and emblem
- Emails sent from Volaby will be using the Volaby logos and colours
- The sign in screen will no longer include the night time mural/background graphics

## Q: Do my volunteers need to do anything?

A: No.

While your team might notice some changes to the way that the newly named Volaby web app looks, nothing is required on their part to continue using Volaby as they always have.
Volunteers will still be able to access Volaby through the Campfire URL, but we will encourage them to start using our new URL.

## Q: Will we have to update all of the places that we link to Campfire?

A: Not immediately.

All of your existing links will seamlessly redirect to the Volaby URL. These might be links to apply, sign in, or any permanent links that you use amongst your teams to direct to certain programs, activities, etc. We will support this redirect for at least another year, and indefinitely after that.

## Q: Should I update any of my documents or website pages that reference Campfire?

A: Yes, if it's convenient.

Once we launch on Monday, 26 October, then all traces of Campfire will disappear from our end. Although the functionality will remain identical, Volaby will be what the volunteer sees. If your volunteers see Campfire in one place but Volaby in another it could cause confusion of uncertainty, particular in new applicants. If you have any key documentation or posts that talk about Campfire it's best that you update these to refer to Volaby; especially if it's content that you expect your volunteers to view.

## Q: Is your website changing too?

A: Yep.

The `campfireapp.org` website will start automatically redirecting to a new site, with roughly the same look and feel but some slightly updated content.

## Q: Who can I share this with?

A: Your leadership team and other managers.

Volunteers will be given their own set of FAQs later, with some questions and answers. Feel free to forward this to anybody who didn't receive the original email to managers and organisation leaders.
