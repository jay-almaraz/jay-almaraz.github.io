# Campfire is rebranding!
{: .fs-10 }

We're excited about the future, and we had a desire to create a unique identity that symbolises the impact we're trying to make on the community. We love what we have created with Campfire and what it represents to us, you, and our team. However, we wanted something that could stand on its own and truly demonstrate the space in which we are trying to reinvent. 

Volaby represents everything volunteering from A to B, and encompasses our goal of making the volunteering experience as simple as A to B for individuals, teams, and organisations. We're also proud of our heritage and that we built this solution from our own experiences and as such have carried that Orange Sky colours into Volaby.

## Q: Why are we rebranding?

A: We believe the timing is perfect for a rebrand. We’re now over 18 months into helping volunteer-involving organisations, and we believe we understand, more than ever, the needs of our partners (that’s you!) We want to reflect our aims to support you further in creating impact and adding value; rebranding to Volaby aligns us perfectly with this vision.

## Q: What does Volaby mean?

A: Volaby is volunteering, simple as A to B.

We don’t sell tents. We want to work with volunteers to build the simplest tool that we can. Our goal is to connect good people (you) with good technology (us), and we want it to feel as simple as A to B.

## Q: Will anything look different?

A: Yes, but only colours and logos.

The logos and icons will all start using the new Volaby name and emblem. Shortcut icons will also update themselves after a couple of visits.

The sign in screen will no longer include the night time mural/background graphics.

## Q: Will emails be coming from a different place?

A: Yes, new sender will be `Volaby (noreply@volaby.org)`. These emails will also feature the new logos and colours.

## Q: Has any functionality changed?

A: No.

Everything will still be the same for now. We have big plans for Volaby, but for now everything is still exactly where it always has been.

## Q: Do I need to do anything?

A: No.

While you might notice some changes to the way that the newly named Volaby web app looks, nothing is required on your part to continue using Volaby as you always have. 

## Q: Will we have to update all of the places that we link to Campfire? (Reposition this)

A: Not immediately.

All of your existing links will seamlessly redirect to the Volaby URL. You will still be able to access Volaby through the Campfire URL, but we will encourage you to start using our new URL.

## Q: Is the Campfire (Volaby) website changing too?

A: Yep.

The `campfireapp.org` website will start automatically redirecting to a new site, with look roughly the same but will now include updated content.

## Q: What about your Facebook, Instagram, etc.?

If you're already following us, great! The same accounts will remain, but everything will be updated to the new `@volaby` content. If you're yet to follow our socials, now is the chance to keep up to date with Volaby tech4good content, get in touch and share your thoughts, and subscribe to  stories from heaps of our other partner orgs.
