# Creating a new shift

In this guide we will run you through creating a new shift in Campfire. Shifts are a core system, and form the base for teams, rosters, and shift reports. Volunteers join teams which are tied to shifts. Managers publish rosters which use volunteers from a team. Shift reports are submitted to tie your on-the-ground impact with a specific time, place, and team of vollies; a shift!

## Open the Add New Shift form

1. Open the Shift Management screen
2. Hit `ADD NEW SHIFT`

## Choose the service and frequency

3. Select the City and the type of Service that this shift will cover
4. Configure the Shift Frequency, Day, and Start and End times

> Selecting 'Once-off' from the frequency options will apply a special configuration to your shift. It will only run once, for the date that you specify, but will be shown in a special section on the All Locations page, so that volunteers can find it more easily. If your shift operates for a limited time then adding an End Date to automatically close the shift after that date has passed.

## Choose a location for your new shift to operate

### (a) Existing location

If you are using a location that you've already setup in Campfire, choose `Existing Service Location`. Select the location from the dropdown.

### (b) New location

If you are creating a shift at a new location then chose `New Service Location`.

1. Give the location a distinct name, so that you can tell it apart from other locations - This name could be the name of the service provider that you operate alongside, the nickname of the owner of the building, or even the street name.
1. Complete the rest of the standard address fields.
1. (Optional) add comments or photos if you want to let your volunteers know anything specific about the location - This might include parking instructions, uniform requirements, or photos of the shift itself

> Comments and photos will appear in the description section on the All Locations pages. Volunteers can see this info before joining the team for that shift.

## Submit your new shift

Once you've completed the shift information and location details, hit `SUBMIT` to create the shift. Once the shift is created you'll be taken back to the Active Shifts view. You can find your newly created shift if you select the city you created it in, and check out the list below.
