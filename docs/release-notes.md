# Volaby - Release Notes
{: .fs-10 }

Updates and upgrades inspired by you and your volunteers, with love from our team to yours.

## October 2020

### `Volaby 2.0.0` - 30 October

With the launch of our new name, we are officially version 2.0! No massive changes were made alongside the launch of Volaby, but we're excited to share all the new features and enhancements we've been working on to make Volaby work better for you. These features and fixes were released weekly throughout October, in an effort to ensure that the improvements reached you and your team as soon as possible. We hope you enjoy these changes!

- **Remove applicants from incoming volunteers:** Managers will find the 'Remove Applicant' button when viewing a profile on incoming volunteers. You can use this to remove individual applicants from the list. Removed applicants get an email advising them that their account has been closed.
- **Export a CSV of your incoming volunteers:** Managers can download the list of incoming volunteers as a CSV file. The file includes email addresses, account status, task completion progress, and more.
- **More access to volunteer info:** The volunteer database has received a nifty upgrade that makes sure more data is available. The full volunteer profile can now be added to the table view, including tasks from their onboarding, and stats from their personal impact profiles. The ability to show and hide columns on the table view has also been added.
- **Filtered downloads in the volunteer database:** Instead of exporting a full dataset the volunteer database will now only export the current view of the database. What you see is what you get!
- **Keep tasks updated on behalf of your volunteers:** Managers can now help volunteers with updating submitted task responses. Open any volunteer profile through the volunteer database and view an individual task to find the 'Edit task' button. Managers can't make changes to the core volunteer profile just yet.
- **Request for change of details form:** Need to update your name, email, or important info on your volunteer profile? Send us a change of details request by submitting the in-app form under 'Volunteer Profile' in account settings.
- **Add attachments to tasks:** On the volunteer profile task builder, in the admin console, you'll now find 'Content' instead of 'Instructions'. Content can include text and file attachments alongside rich text. Add any important files or documents that your applicants will need to access while completing the task.
- **Activity report facelift:** We've redesigned the activity report screen with a focus on simplifying the interface to make it easier for volunteers to start reports. If you're a manager and you can't find what you're looking for hit he 'View in Activities Console' to go to the timeline and browse all history.
- **Activities sorted by next occurrence:** The activities map views will now be arranged in order of when they are next scheduled to run. This should make the list of activities easier to work with for volunteers and managers.

## September 2020

### `Volaby 1.2.0` - 25 September

We're stoked to bring you Volaby's September update, with a load of new activities features. Everything that we talk about in this release can be applied to new activities and existing activities. Visit any existing activity and hit `Edit` to reveal all of the new functionality. Your existing activities are still exactly as they were before this release, so you don't need to make any changes right now if you don't want to.

- **Hide activities**: You can now [hide an activity](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/creating-an-activity/#privacy-settings) to make it private, which will remove it from the map on the volunteer's side. A hidden activity will remain visible to volunteers who are on that activity's team, and to all relevant managers through the activities console.

- **Remote activities**: Activities can now exist [without requiring a physical address](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/creating-an-activity/#location). A bunch of you are already using activities to hold remote meetings, or schedule phone calls. Now you can remove the physical location altogether to avoid confusion and keep the map tidy. You can even attach a URL or phone number for those important group hustles!

- **Flexible activities**: Activities now come in two flavours: regular and flexible. Regular activities are exactly as they were before this release, whereas [flexible activities](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/creating-an-activity/#activity-type) open the door to whole new world of sporadic opportunities that are easier to use, and won't clutter your timelines with irrelevant rosters and reports.

- **Instant rosters**: An essential sibling to flexible activities, [instant rosters](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/create-an-instant-roster/) allow you to create rosters on dates that don't correspond to an activities original schedule.

- **Rich text activity and session descriptions**: Links, styling, formatting; you can do it all now with rich text descriptions available to all activities and sessions.

## August 2020

### `Volaby 1.1.0` - 25 August

- **Open Activities**: Open activities allow any volunteer to join the team without needing to wait for approval. In a single click, a new volunteer will be able to put themselves into an activity team and start settings their availabilities with zero delay. You can edit any of your existing activities to switch them to _Open_ too. [Read about using the new open activity setting](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/creating-an-activity/)

- **Improved experience when joining activities**: We are trying out a new and improved interface for volunteers to use when joining activities. The aim with this is to present a simpler set of messages for vollies who are applying to join a public or private team at any time. You can see these interfaces in action in our [new volunteer tutorial](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/volunteers/applying-to-join-a-team/#finding-an-activity).

- **Bulletins**: Need to share important information to all of your volunteers? Bulletins allow admins to post messages and notify all volunteers via email. Vollies can go back and view any bulletin at any time. You can find the [bulletins dashboard in the _Admin Console_](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/posting-updates-with-bulletins/), and view posted bulletins through the _My Elements_ page.

- **My Elements layout update**: We've restyled the My Elements page to give it more room to breath, with bulletins now added into the mix.

## July 2020

### `Volaby 1.0.0` - 29 July

- **Volunteer onboarding system upgrade (Set up your profile)**: With this release we bring a massively enhanced experience to the volunteers who are joining your team. We have split the volunteer onboarding flow into three distinct and easy to manage parts. [Read about the new volunteer flow](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/configuring-your-onboarding-flow/)

- **Volunteer profile admin console**: So that you can give your volunteers the best experience possible, we are giving you more control. The Admin Console > Volunteer Profile interface has been upgraded to a customisation powerhouse. Get the most out of this feature by re-ordering your existing tasks, or add more headings and instructions to give more structure. We don't recommend that you delete any existing tasks or fields just yet, unless you are absolutely certain you want to forfeit the data. [See what you can do with the volunteer profile dashboard](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/configuring-your-onboarding-flow/#creating-a-task)

- **Incoming volunteers upgrade**: Keeping track of volunteers between the stages of their onboarding was a pain, so we looked at all of the ways we could make it better. The [new Incoming Volunteers system](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/tracking-onboarding-with-incoming-volunteers/) now lives alongside the Volunteer Database under the 'Volunteers' page. There is no longer any mixing of active volunteers and incoming volunteers, and we have added some cool status labels and progress bars to help you manage your future heroes.
