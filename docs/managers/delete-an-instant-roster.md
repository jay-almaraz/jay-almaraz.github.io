# Delete an instant roster
{: .fs-10 }

---

An instant roster can be deleted if it has not been published. This will usually be needed if an instant roster was created for an incorrect date, or activity. Instant rosters that have already been published cannot be deleted, and must be cancelled. This allows Campfire to notify rostered volunteers of the change.

An instant roster that is deleted will be removed entirely from the timeline. This canâ€™t be undone, but another instant roster can always be created in place of the deleted roster.
