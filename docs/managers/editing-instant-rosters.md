# Editing instant rosters
{: .fs-10 }

---

The date, notes, and location on an instant roster can be edited so long as the roster has not run. To edit these details open the roster from the timeline and hit Edit Roster, located next to the publish button.

If youâ€™re changing the date of an already published roster, you will be prompted to cancel this existing roster. Volunteers will be notified of the cancellation and the roster will have to be rebuilt.
