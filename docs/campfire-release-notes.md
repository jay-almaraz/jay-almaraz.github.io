## September 2020

### `Volaby 1.2.0` - 25 September

We're stoked to bring you Volaby's September update, with a load of new activities features. Everything that we talk about in this release can be applied to new activities and existing activities. Visit any existing activity and hit `Edit` to reveal all of the new functionality. Your existing activities are still exactly as they were before this release, so you don't need to make any changes right now if you don't want to.

- **Hide activities**: You can now [hide an activity](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/creating-an-activity/#privacy-settings) to make it private, which will remove it from the map on the volunteer's side. A hidden activity will remain visible to volunteers who are on that activity's team, and to all relevant managers through the activities console.

- **Remote activities**: Activities can now exist [without requiring a physical address](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/creating-an-activity/#location). A bunch of you are already using activities to hold remote meetings, or schedule phone calls. Now you can remove the physical location altogether to avoid confusion and keep the map tidy. You can even attach a URL or phone number for those important group hustles!

- **Flexible activities**: Activities now come in two flavours: regular and flexible. Regular activities are exactly as they were before this release, whereas [flexible activities](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/creating-an-activity/#activity-type) open the door to whole new world of sporadic opportunities that are easier to use, and won't clutter your timelines with irrelevant rosters and reports.

- **Instant rosters**: An essential sibling to flexible activities, [instant rosters](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/create-an-instant-roster/) allow you to create rosters on dates that don't correspond to an activities original schedule.

- **Rich text activity and session descriptions**: Links, styling, formatting; you can do it all now with rich text descriptions available to all activities and sessions.

## August 2020

### `Volaby 1.1.0` - 25 August

- **Open Activities**: Open activities allow any volunteer to join the team without needing to wait for approval. In a single click, a new volunteer will be able to put themselves into an activity team and start settings their availabilities with zero delay. You can edit any of your existing activities to switch them to _Open_ too. [Read about using the new open activity setting](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/creating-an-activity/)

- **Improved experience when joining activities**: We are trying out a new and improved interface for volunteers to use when joining activities. The aim with this is to present a simpler set of messages for vollies who are applying to join a public or private team at any time. You can see these interfaces in action in our [new volunteer tutorial](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/volunteers/applying-to-join-a-team/#finding-an-activity).

- **Bulletins**: Need to share important information to all of your volunteers? Bulletins allow admins to post messages and notify all volunteers via email. Vollies can go back and view any bulletin at any time. You can find the [bulletins dashboard in the _Admin Console_](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/posting-updates-with-bulletins/), and view posted bulletins through the _My Elements_ page.

- **My Elements layout update**: We've restyled the My Elements page to give it more room to breath, with bulletins now added into the mix.

## July 2020

### `Volaby 1.0.0` - 29 July

- **Volunteer onboarding system upgrade (Set up your profile)**: With this release we bring a massively enhanced experience to the volunteers who are joining your team. We have split the volunteer onboarding flow into three distinct and easy to manage parts. [Read about the new volunteer flow](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/configuring-your-onboarding-flow/)

- **Volunteer profile admin console**: So that you can give your volunteers the best experience possible, we are giving you more control. The Admin Console > Volunteer Profile interface has been upgraded to a customisation powerhouse. Get the most out of this feature by re-ordering your existing tasks, or add more headings and instructions to give more structure. We don't recommend that you delete any existing tasks or fields just yet, unless you are absolutely certain you want to forfeit the data. [See what you can do with the volunteer profile dashboard](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/configuring-your-onboarding-flow/#creating-a-task)

- **Incoming volunteers upgrade**: Keeping track of volunteers between the stages of their onboarding was a pain, so we looked at all of the ways we could make it better. The [new Incoming Volunteers system](https://guide.volaby.org/docs/managers/tracking-onboarding-with-incoming-volunteers/) now lives alongside the Volunteer Database under the 'Volunteers' page. There is no longer any mixing of active volunteers and incoming volunteers, and we have added some cool status labels and progress bars to help you manage your future heroes.
