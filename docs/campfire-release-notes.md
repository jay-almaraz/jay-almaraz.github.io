# Campfire 1.0.0

## July 29, 2020

- **Volunteer onboarding system upgrade (Set up your profile)** With this release we bring a massively enhanced experience to the volunteers who are joining your team. We have split the volunteer onboarding flow into three distinct and easy to manage parts. [Read about the new volunteer flow](https://guide.campfireapp.org/docs/managers/configuring-your-onboarding-flow/)

- **Volunteer profile admin console** So that you can give your volunteers the best experience possible, we are giving you more control. The Admin Console > Volunteer Profile interface has been upgraded to a customisation powerhouse. Get the most out of this feature by re-ordering your existing tasks, or add more headings and instructions to give more structure. We don't recommend that you delete any existing tasks or fields just yet, unless you are absolutely certain you want to forfeit the data. [See what you can do with the volunteer profile dashboard](https://guide.campfireapp.org/docs/managers/configuring-your-onboarding-flow/#creating-a-task)

- **Incoming volunteers upgrade** Keeping track of volunteers between the stages of their onboarding was a pain, so we looked at all of the ways we could make it better. The [new Incoming Volunteers system](https://guide.campfireapp.org/docs/managers/tracking-onboarding-with-incoming-volunteers/) now lives alongside the Volunteer Database under the 'Volunteers' page. There is no longer any mixing of active volunteers and incoming volunteers, and we have added some cool status labels and progress bars to help you manage your future heroes.
