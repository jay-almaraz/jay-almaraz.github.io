# Applying for a Campfire account

Before you begin your volunteering journey on Campfire, you will need to have a valid account, and this article covers the steps that will help get you there. 

## Application form

The very first step is to complete an application form containing a simple set of questions, and the link to this form will be provided by your organisation. 

## Confirmation and next steps
After you have submitted your application form, you should receive an initial email from Campfire confirming that your application has been received. Upon approval of your application, a second email will be sent, containing your first time password and instructions to update your password after logging in. 

## Required documents
Depending on your organisationâ€™s requirements, you may need to complete required documents before the volunteer contract can be accessed. You can find these under the Required Documents tab in the navigation menu.

## Volunteer contract
Once you have completed your required documents, you will be able to access the volunteer contract, which needs to be verified by the organisation in order for you to unlock your full volunteering account. The volunteer contract can be found under the Volunteer Contract page. 

## Contract verification
Depending on whether your organisation has automated verification set up, after submitting your contract you will either be logged in automatically or you will need to wait for the organisation to review your contract.
