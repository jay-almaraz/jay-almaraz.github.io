# Applying for a Campfire account

Before you begin your volunteering journey on Campfire, you will need to have a valid account, and this article covers the steps that will help get you there. 

## Application form

The very first step is to complete an application form containing a simple set of questions, and the link to this form will be provided by your organisation. 

## Confirmation and next steps
After submitting your application form, you will receive an email confirming that your application has been received. Upon approval of your application, a second email containing your first time password will be sent. You will be asked to update your password immesiately after logging in for the first time. 

## Required documents
Depending on your organisationâ€™s requirements, you may need to complete required documents before the volunteer contract can be accessed. You can find these under the _Required Documents_ tab in the navigation menu.

## Volunteer contract
The volunteer contract is located in the _Volunteer Contract_ page and is only accessible after you have completed your required documents. This contract needs to be verified by the organisation in order for you to unlock your full volunteering account. 

## Contract verification
Depending on whether your organisation has automated verification set up, after submitting your contract you will either be logged in automatically or you will need to wait for your contract to be reviewed by your organisation.
